# CppND-Garbage-Collector
This repository includes the final project for this Memory Management course, where implementation of
own smart pointer has to be done. You can think of this as implementing your own
GARBAGE COLLECTOR, to use a concept from other programming languages. Building
this project will help you understand both how to work with pointers and
references, and also why smart pointers are so important to modern C++
programming. 

# Building
To build this project, you will need a C++ compiler. The `make` script provided
assumes the GCC compiler, however you may substitute an equivalent C++ compiler
by adjusting the `make` script as needed. Execute the make script, then run the
compiled executable.

If the code fails to compile, the execute won't be created or will remain the
last-compiled version. Adjust your code to resolve compiler errors and try again.

``` shell
$ ./make
$ ./compiled
```
